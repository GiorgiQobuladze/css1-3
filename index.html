        <p id="list2">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including astronomy, physics, philosophy,
            and
            metaphysics. The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:</p>

            <p id="blok1">Big Bang Theory</p>
            <p id="blok2">This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe. The Big
                Bang theory
                suggests that the history of the universe began with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a
                result of the Big Bang, time, space, and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the
                cosmos.</p>

            <p id="blok4">Black Hole Theory</p>
            <p id="blok5">Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. These are regions where gravity is
                so intense
                that nothing, not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby matter and can emit
                radiation.</p>

            <p id="blok7">String Theory</p>
        </div>

        <div id="list6">
            <p id="blok8">String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description of the physical world.
                According to this
                theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain additional
                microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with
                different sizes and characteristics.</p>

        <div id="list7">
            <p id="blok9">Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>
        </div>
        <div id="list8">
            <ul id="blok10">
                <li>Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks to provide a single framework that explains
                    all fundamental forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, electromagnetism, and
                    quantum mechanics.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional space, string theory proposes the
                    existence of additional microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially influencing the
                    laws of physics.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, the fundamental building blocks of matter are not
                    point-like particles but rather one-dimensional "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
                    with each vibration corresponding to a different particle type.</li>
